I grew up in Italy during a time when computers only belonged in businesses and big organizations. My father was one of the computer
 pioneers in Italy. It was my father which transmitted me the passion for computers and everything that comes with it. By age 13, under my
 fatherâ€™s direction, I wrote a full fledged accounting software. One accounting application he developed in the late 80s, was retired in 2015;
 the application was custom built to a point that finding a replacement was not possible for a long time.
 
I believe that a software engineer can pick up any part of computers because everything is software, so if you mastered software development,
you can automatically master any subject that derives from it.
 
During my long career, I have always pushed the envelope to the next boundary. My main goal in my professional life has always
been to simplify.
 
My professional career is full of cutting-edge achievements. Starting from being a pioneer in Internet technologies, I was part
of the first team in Europe, in 1993 to implement a military non-secure IP network. Also I pioneered many internet file exchange protocols
in the 90s allowing data exchange to be performed better, cheaper, and faster using the internet. During the later part of my career, I
moved to virtualization and cloud systems, in which I pioneered many technologies alloweing major reduction in cost and increased productivity.
 
I am also a soccer enthusiast, enjoys playing piano, and billiards.
